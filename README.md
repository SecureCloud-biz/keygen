This is an experiment to see whether client side certificates can actually be
used with normal people, who don't really understand what HTTP or SSL are.

## Contributing
Please contribute! Raise issues or fork and we'll chat! I'd love if someone
reputable would write an idiots guide to client-side certificates and the risks
involved.

## Examples
I've written one example server, which signs the client-certificates. If you
don't like Python, please contribute another example server so others can see
how to sign certificates in other languages.

### python2-flask
The one and only example server is written in Python and uses Flask - the
lightweight web framework; Flask requires Python 2, rather than Python 3.

Instructions on running the server locally will follow.

I have reimplemented the [GitHub Ribbons][1], which uses the font *Collegiate*.
